My tech stack. Come at me.

🛤️ Ruby on Rails — "Isn't that dead?" No. Shopify does $7B/year on it. Next question.
🐘 PostgreSQL — The Switzerland of databases. Nobody argues about Postgres.
🌐 Headless Chrome — For the actual rendering engine
🖥️ Single server — No Kubernetes, no microservices, no 47-page infra diagram

Total monthly cost: $20.

I could've used Next.js + Vercel + PlanetScale + 14 edge functions + a service mesh + a prayer. But I chose to ship instead.

The best tech stack is the one that lets you launch this week. Everything else is procrastination with extra steps.

Hot take? Maybe. But Rendly is live and your over-engineered side project isn't.
